---Testing a Vending Machine---

Requirements & Assumptions
- A regular common vending machine can be placed in shopping mall or school campus
- Should take different types of payment: coin, bill, credit card(swipe/tap), apple pay etc.
- How does the vending machine powered? 
- Does it connect to the internet?
- Where does the machine placed? Outdoor or in door?
- Does the machine give changes?

Functionality test:
1. Happy pass, buy 1 item and pay the amount(Test different types of transactions/combination of coin/bill/cc)
2. Happy pass, Select multiple items in one go, and pay the amount
3. Select an item, and leave the system in "ready to pay" screen - Ensure it is will exit after reasonable time, say 30 secs
4. Buy the same item in mutiple iterations - Ensure the flows are same for different iterations
5. Select an empty item - Ensure system shows the error to the user e.g. "Please select a different item" 
6. Enter the row/col which is out of the range of the item shelf - Ensure system shows the error to the user e.g. "Please select a different item" 
7. 

Security test
1. Assuming the item is placed outdoor - Ensure the safty of the power cord
2. Ensure the hardware is roburst enough to prevent theif activity 
3. Ensure the card data and transaction info are encrypted(online/offline)
4. Ensure the payment module can work with different Merchant account


Usability test
1. Ensure the machine can be operated in different temperature/humidity
2. The labels on the item are clear and easy to read
3. The whole process can be done in a reasonable time frame 
4. Key pad and buttons are responsive

Stress test
1. Ensure the machine can be operated in different temperature/humidity
2. The system doesn't slow down for say 1000 iterations(longevity test)

Hardware test
1. Dimensions of the vending machine are correct
2. Each component is well connected to each other(wire connections)
3. Error message(code) should show if there is a hardware failure
